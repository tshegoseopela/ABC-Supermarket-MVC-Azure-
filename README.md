# ABC-Supermarket-MVC-Azure-
develop a website for a local township supermarket using MVC and MS Azure
==========================================================================
•	Backend code that enables the website administrators to load items with the parameters (item name, description, image, and price)
•	Enable the administrator to use basic CRUD functionality. (add item, update item, and delete item)
•	Used the Azure Blob Containers to enable the administrator to upload images of the item and included File Share to ensure there were no duplicates
•	Used Azure Queue (only used once) to ensure communication between different mediums based off logic created and information from the databases
